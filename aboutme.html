            Hello, my name is Hanyi and I am 18 years old. I come from China. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and watching TV series, as they allow me to relax while also learning about different ideas, cultures, and stories. My favorite subjects in school are mathematics and philosophy because they challenge me to think logically, solve problems, and understand the world from different perspectives.
            One of my personal goals is to learn Spanish, as I believe that speaking multiple languages will help me connect with more people and broaden my opportunities in the future. I also hope to further develop my programming skills. I am particularly interested in website development and would like to create useful, creative, and visually appealing websites someday.
            I consider myself a curious and hardworking person. I enjoy exploring new topics, taking on challenges, and improving step by step. Whether it is learning a new language, studying a difficult concept, or practicing coding, I always try to stay motivated and open-minded. Overall, I am eager to grow both academically and personally, and I look forward to learning many new skills in the future.
